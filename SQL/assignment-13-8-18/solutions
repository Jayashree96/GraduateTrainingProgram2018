1) What are the most important sql commands
 create, alter, drop, select, insert, delete, update
2)What is an Entity,Attribute,Record,operator
 An entity is a real world object about which the data is collected and stored. Ex:student
 An attribute is the information about entity. Ex:student id, stuent name.
 A record is a entry in a table containing one or more values. Group of records are stored in a table. It is often called a  row.
 Operators used to perform arithmetic operations and comparisons. Used with where clause
3)Why is it essential to select columns in a resultset instead of doing a select *.What is the use of distinct
 selecting columns is the efficient way than select * since selecting specific columns will be faster and it reduces  complexity. Distinct is used to avoid duplicates. 
4)What is the difference between Where and Having
 where clause is used with select query where it filters rows with the condition specified. Having clause is used with the aggregate function where it filers a group with the specified condition.
5)What are the different operators used in Where.difference between And not and OR
 Arithmetic operators
 Logical operators
 Conditional operators
 AND- gives the result when both the conditions in a and statement are satisfied.
 OR- gives the result when either of the conditions is satisfied
 NOT- gives the result in conrast to the specified condition
6)what is the difference between Group by and order by when do we use them
 Group by is used with select query which is used to group similar data.
 Order by is used to sort the data in ascending or descending order based on a single or multiple columns.
7)What is an aggregate function.Specify the different types of aggregate functions
 An aggregate function is used to perform calculation on a group of values and give a single value as a result.
 Commonly used aggregate functions are avg(),min(),max(),count(),sum()
8)What is a constraint.What is a primary key,Foreign key?Why do we use them
 Constraints are rules on one or more columns on the table that limits the type of data entering into the table.
 Primary key- uniquely identifies each row in a table
 Foreign key-refers to the primary key from another table.
9)What is an index?Why do we use indexing?
 An index is used for easy and faster retrieval of datas from the table.
10)What is an view.
 A view is a table created by selecting fields from one or more tables available in a database. It can have all the rows or  specific rows from a table based on a condition.
11)Specify the different type of joins with an example?
 consider table student and course
 stu_id  stu_name  course_id                    course_id   course_name
  1.      aarthi      001                           001         java
  2.      bavya       002                           002         python
  3.      divya       001                           003         sql
  4.      kavitha     004
 
 inner join- inner join joins all matching values from both the tables
   stu_id  stu_name  course_id  course_name
  1.      aarthi      001           java
  2.      bavya       002           python
  3.      divya       001           java
 
 left outer join- returns all values from left table and matching records from right table
  stu_id  stu_name  course_id    course_name
  1.      aarthi      001           java
  2.      bavya       002           python
  3.      divya       001           java
  4.      kavitha     004
  
 right outer join- returns all values from right table and matching records from left table.
  stu_id  stu_name  course_id   course_name
  1.      aarthi      001           java
  2.      bavya       002           python
  3.      divya       001           java 
                      003           sql              
 
 full outer join-returns all matching records either in left or right table
 stu_id  stu_name  course_id   course_name
  1.      aarthi      001         java
  2.      bavya       002         python
  3.      divya       001         java
  4.      kavitha     004     
                      003         sql     
 
 self join - self join joins a table with the same table.
